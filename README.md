# Babel Plugin Goober CSS Prop

Most of the code here is from [`babel-plugin-css-prop`](https://github.com/satya164/babel-plugin-css-prop) which has been customised for [`goober`](https://github.com/cristianbote/goober)



This has been tested only for a specific use case for usage with [`twin.macro`](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro). Any contributions welcome.
